//! This is the Stephenson rating algorithm, nicknamed "Sticko" due to it being an improvement on the Glicko rating algorithm.  
//! Allows for player advantages, and the winner of a chess outcome prediction competition.
//!
//! For the original Glicko algorithm, please see [`Glicko`](crate::glicko), or for the improved versions see [`Glicko-Boost`](crate::glicko_boost) or [`Glicko-2`](crate::glicko2).
//!
//! In 2012, the data prediction website [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) hosted the "FIDE/Deloitte Chess Rating Challenge"
//!  where competitors where asked to create a new, more accurate chess rating system.  
//! The winner of the competition was Alec Stephenson, and this was the system he came up with.
//!
//! The main improvements over Glicko are three new configurable parameters found in [`StickoConfig`]:
//!
//! - Gamma (Î³) an advantage parameter that accounts for inherent advantages in-game (White in Chess, etc.)
//! - Beta (Î²) a drift parameter that increases rating for participating
//! - Lambda (Î») a parameter that accounts for the strength of the opponent, regardless of result.
//!
//! These make Sticko more configurable and possibly more accurate than the Glicko algorithm.
//! When all parameters are set to 0, the Sticko algorithm will produce the exact same results as Glicko.
//!
//! # Quickstart
//!
//! This is the most basic example on how to use the Sticko Module.  
//! Please take a look at the functions below to see more advanced use cases.
//!
//! ```
//! use skillratings::{
//!     sticko::sticko, outcomes::Outcomes, rating::StickoRating, config::StickoConfig,
//! };
//!
//! // Initialize a new player rating.
//! let player_one = StickoRating::new();
//!
//! // Or you can initialize it with your own values of course.
//! // Imagine these numbers being pulled from a database.
//! let (some_rating, some_deviation) = (1325.0, 230.0);
//! let player_two = StickoRating{
//!     rating: some_rating,
//!     deviation: some_deviation,
//! };
//!
//! // The outcome of the match is from the perspective of player one.
//! let outcome = Outcomes::WIN;
//!
//! // The config allows you to specify certain values in the Sticko calculation.
//! let config = StickoConfig {
//!     // The gamma value describes the advantage of player_one.
//!     // 30.0 is roughly accurate for playing White in Chess.
//!     // If player_two was to play White, change this to -30.0.
//!     // By default it is set to 0.0.
//!     gamma: 30.0,
//!     // We leave the other settings at their default values.
//!     ..Default::default()
//! };
//!
//! // The sticko function will calculate the new ratings for both players and return them.
//! let (new_player_one, new_player_two) = sticko(&player_one, &player_two, &outcome, &config);
//! ```
