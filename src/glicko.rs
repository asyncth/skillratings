//! The Glicko algorithm, developed by Mark Glickman as an improvement on Elo.  
//! It is still being used in some games in favor Glicko-2, such as Pok√©mon Showdown and Quake Live.
//!
//! If you are looking for the updated Glicko-2 rating system, please see [`Glicko-2`](crate::glicko2).
//!
//! The main improvement over Elo is the rating deviation introduced,
//! which decreases over time as the player plays more matches and the rating becomes more reliable.
//! This allows players to rise and fall through the ranks quickly at the beginning,
//! and not gain or lose as much rating points after completing more matches.
//!
//! # Quickstart
//!
//! This is the most basic example on how to use the Glicko Module.  
//! Please take a look at the functions below to see more advanced use cases.
//!
//! ```
//! use skillratings::{
//!     glicko::glicko, outcomes::Outcomes, rating::GlickoRating
//! };
//!
//! // Initialise a new player rating.
//! let player_one = GlickoRating::new();
//!
//! // Or you can initialise it with your own values of course.
//! // Imagine these numbers being pulled from a database.
//! let (some_rating, some_deviation) = (1325.0, 230.0);
//! let player_two = GlickoRating{
//!     rating: some_rating,
//!     deviation: some_deviation,
//! };
//!
//! // The outcome of the match is from the perspective of player one.
//! let outcome = Outcomes::WIN;
//!
//! // The glicko function will calculate the new ratings for both players and return them.
//! let (new_player_one, new_player_two) = glicko(&player_one, &player_two, &outcome);
//! ```
